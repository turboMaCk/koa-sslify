    <p>Enforce HTTPS middleware for Koa.js</p>
</div>

[Koa.js](http://koajs.com/) middleware to enforce HTTPS connection on any incoming requests.
In case of a non-encrypted HTTP request, koa-sslify automatically redirects to an HTTPS address using a `301 permanent redirect`
(or optionally `307 Temporary Redirect`).

Koa SSLify can also work behind reverse proxies (load balancers) like on Heroku, Azure, GCP Ingress etc
and supports custom implementations of proxy resolvers.

## Install

```
$ npm install --save koa-sslify
```

## Usage

Importing default factory function:

```javascript
const sslify = require('koa-sslify').default; // factory with default options
const Koa = require('koa');

app = new Koa();
app.use(sslify());
```

Default function accepts several options.

| Name                      | Type          | Default           | Description                                          |
|---------------------------|---------------|-------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `resolver`                | Function      | `httpsResolver`   | Function used to test if request is secure           |
| `hostname`                | Function      | `undefined`       | Function that takes the request hostname string as its only argument and returns the desired hostname to use as a result. Uses request hostname if not set or return value is falsy |
| `port`                    | Integer       | `443`             | Port of HTTPS server                                 |
| `ignoreUrl`               | Boolean       | `false`           | Ignore url path (redirect to domain)                 |
| `temporary`               | Boolean       | `false`           | Temporary mode (use 307 Temporary Redirect)          |
| `skipDefaultPort`         | Boolean       | `true`            | Avoid `:443` port in redirect url                    |
| `redirectMethods`         | Array<String> | `['GET', 'HEAD']` | Whitelist methods that should be redirected          |
| `disallowStatus`          | Integer       | `405`             | Status returned for disallowed methods               |

### Resolvers

Resolver is a function from classic Koa `ctx` object to boolean.
This function is used to determine if request is or is not secured (true means is secure).
Middleware calls this function and based on its returned value either passes
control to next middleware or responds to the request with appropriate redirect response.

There are several resolvers provided by this library but it should be very easy to implement
any type of custom check as well.

for instance, Heroku has a reverse proxy that uses `x-forwarded-proto` header.
This is how you can configure app with this resolver:

```js
const {
  default: sslify, // middleware factory
  xForwardedProtoResolver: resolver // resolver needed
} = require('koa-sslify');
const Koa = require('koa');

app = new Koa();

// init middleware with resolver
app.use(sslify({ resolver }));
```

Those are all resolver provided by default:

| `xForwardedProtoResolver`   | Heroku, Google Ingress                                                                 | `sslify({ resolver: xForwardedProtoResolver })`         |
| `azureResolver`             | Azure                                                                                  | `sslify({ resolver: azureResolver })`                   |
| `customProtoHeaderResolver` | any non-standard implementation (Kong)                                                 | `sslify({ resolver: customProtoHeader('x-protocol') })` |
| `forwardedResolver`         | [standard header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Forwarded) | `sslify({ resolver: forwardedResolver })`               |

Some additional information about reverse proxies:

#### Reverse Proxies (Heroku, GCE Ingress and others)

Heroku, GCE Ingress and other hosters often use reverse proxies which offer SSL endpoints
but then forward unencrypted HTTP traffic to the website.
This makes it difficult to detect if the original request was indeed via HTTPS. Luckily,
most reverse proxies set the `x-forwarded-proto` header flag with the original request scheme.

#### Azure

Azure has a slightly different way of signaling encrypted connections.
It uses `x-arr-ssl` header as a flag to mark https traffic.

### Defining Custom Resolver

If you're still in a situation where you need to use custom resolver you can implement it as for example following:

```javascript
const { default: sslify } = require('koa-sslify');

app.use(sslify({
  resolver: (ctx) => ctx.request.header['x-is-secure'] === 'yup!'
}))
```

Contributions to increase coverage of default resolvers are welcomed.

## Examples

Those are full example apps using Koa SSLify to enforce HTTPS.

### Without Reverse Proxy

This example starts 2 servers for app.

- First HTTP server is listening on port 8080 and redirects to second one
- Second HTTPS server is listening on port 8081

```javascript
const Koa = require('koa');
const http = require('http');
const https = require('https');
const fs = require('fs');
const { default: enforceHttps } = require('koa-sslify');

const app = new Koa();

// Force HTTPS using default resolver
app.use(enforceHttps({
  port: 8081
}));

// index page
app.use(ctx => {
  ctx.body = "hello world from " + ctx.request.url;
});

// SSL options
var options = {
  key: fs.readFileSync('server.key'),
  cert: fs.readFileSync('server.crt')
}

// start the server
http.createServer(app.callback()).listen(8080);
https.createServer(options, app.callback()).listen(8081);
```

### With Reverse Proxy

This example starts a single http server which is designed to run behind
a reverse proxy like Heroku.

```javascript
const Koa = require('koa');
const {
  default: enforceHttps,
  xForwardedProtoResolver: resolver
} = require('koa-sslify');

var app = new Koa();

// Force HTTPS via x-forwarded-proto compatible resolver
app.use(enforceHttps({ resolver }));

// index page
app.use((ctx) => {
  ctx = "hello world from " + ctx.request.url;
});

// proxy will bind this port to it's 443 and 80 ports
app.listen(3000);
```

## Advanced Redirect Setting

### Redirect Methods

By default only `GET` and `HEAD` methods are whitelisted for redirect.
koa-sslify will respond with `405` with appropriate `Allow` header by default.
You can change whitelisted methods by passing `redirectMethods` array to options
as well as change status for disallowed methods using `disallowStatus`.

### Skip Default Port in Redirect URL

**By default port is excluded from redirect url if it's set to `443`.**
Since `443` is default port for `HTTPS` browser will use it by default anyway so there
is no need to explicitly return it as part of URL. Anyway in case you need to **always return port as part of URL string**
you can pass options with `skipDefaultPort: false` to do the trick.
